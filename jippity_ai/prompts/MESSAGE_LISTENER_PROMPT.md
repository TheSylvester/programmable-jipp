A message has been sent in a Discord channel you are monitoring:

<incoming_message>

</incoming_message>

Context to consider:

<channel_history>
{{history_string}}
</channel_history>

Analyze the incoming message and determine:

- speaker's identity and role in the conversation
- message intent
- intended audience of the message
- what the speaker may expect as a response
- conversation turn and who should respond next
- whether '{{bot_username}}' should respond
- reason for why `{{bot_username}}` should or should not respond
